# Cities: Skylines 2 Save File Sharing Website

## Project Overview
A web platform where users can upload and share Cities: Skylines 2 save files (.cok files) to showcase their cities. The website displays city statistics and information extracted from save files in an attractive card format.

## Features

### Core Features
- [x] User authentication (NextAuth.js already configured)
- [x] Database setup (Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL)
- [x] File upload system for .cok files
- [x] File processing (rename to .zip, extract, parse .SaveGameMetadata)
- [x] City data storage in database
- [x] Home page with recently updated cities
- [x] City cards displaying statistics
- [x] Upload page (protected, requires login)

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table (already exists)
User (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(64),
  password VARCHAR(64)
)

-- Cities table (to be created)
City (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  userId INTEGER REFERENCES User(id),
  cityName VARCHAR(255),
  mapName VARCHAR(255),
  population INTEGER,
  money INTEGER,
  xp INTEGER,
  theme VARCHAR(100),
  preview VARCHAR(255),
  saveGameData VARCHAR(255),
  sessionGuid VARCHAR(255),
  gameMode VARCHAR(50),
  autoSave BOOLEAN,
  leftHandTraffic BOOLEAN,
  naturalDisasters BOOLEAN,
  unlockAll BOOLEAN,
  unlimitedMoney BOOLEAN,
  unlockMapTiles BOOLEAN,
  simulationDate JSON,
  contentPrerequisites TEXT[],
  modsEnabled TEXT[],
  fileName VARCHAR(255),
  uploadedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

#### File Processing Flow
1. User uploads .cok file
2. Server renames file to .zip
3. Extract zip contents
4. Find and parse .SaveGameMetadata file
5. Store metadata in database
6. Store file in cloud storage (optional)
7. Display city card on home page

#### Pages Structure
- `/` - Home page with recently updated cities
- `/upload` - Protected upload page (requires login)
- `/login` - Login page (already exists)
- `/register` - Register page (already exists)
- `/protected` - Protected dashboard (already exists)
